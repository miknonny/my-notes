Amgularjs and dependecy injection

dependency injection has to deal writing small untis of code the wiring all the small units of code when you are done.

dependency injection makes you write less code.
it is highly extensible.
it is much more easier to test.

Lets start.
here note that in most apps we have been building like the todo app, after checking some todos
and deleting we see that on refresh all that we deleted are back. this is because
every thing is hardcoded in the controller and there is no way we could have been 
able to delete.

Now we need to get an instance of omngodb.
Now here we will be using mongolab. because they provide for me mongodb and aa resful
api.

The idea is to abstract all the data inclded in the logic and make it a service.
This service will be responsible for sending  all the request, sending proper header.
parsing the response and all this stuff related to mongolab.

think about the mongolab as a model.
