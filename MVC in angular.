MVC in angular.

Model = Javascript objects.

$scope.files = ['foo', 'bar', 'baz'];

View = HTML

<div ng-repeat="f in files"></div>

controller = Plain Javascript code.
The controller maps the relation between the ui and the model

function addfile (filename) {
	$scope.files.push(fileName);
}


note that in angular everything runs in the client. We just talk to the server to get the data that the application need.

THE DOM.
-data binding and directives.

Databinding.
This allows us to set up the model and the view in thesame way that we setup
spreadshits. i.e when we make changes to once cell. those changes are automatically reflected on another cell.

lets look at the following example.

<!doctype html>

<html ng-app>   <!-- this is the application root -->
	<head>
		<script src="angular.min.js"></script>
	</head>

	<body>
		<div>
			<label>Name:</label> <input type="text" ng-model="your name" placeholder="Enter your name">
			<hr>
			<h1>Hello {{your name}}!</h1>
		</div>
	</body>
What this means is that you want to insert some text here{{your namae}} from a model element. in this case ng-model="your name".
such that once some body changes the input it is automatically reflected on the page. This is called databinding.

Directives.
This are bits of code in our html that expands to do something more.
example

<div class='data-picker'
	<div>
		<div>
			...

this will wxpand to show a complete date for us to work with.
